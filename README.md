# Workshop
Group Student Project Unreal
This project was part of a 2-week workshop where we were tasked with creating a game based on the theme of Flappy Bird, similar to a game jam.
I was the sole programmer on this project. The assets (models, animations, SFX, VFX) were created by the other group members, while I focused exclusively on the programming.
